# Dog_Breed_Prediction_ML
In this project, we use Keras and TensorFlow to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of identifying dog breeds from images. This is a supervised multiclass classification problem, where the model is trained on labeled dog images to recognize various breeds.
